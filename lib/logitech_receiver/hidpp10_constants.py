    The Logitech documentation mentions that the first and last (third)

    In practise, the second byte is also used for some device-specific
    notifications (keyboard illumination level). Do not simply set all
    notification bits if the software does not support it. For example,
    enabling keyboard_sleep_raw makes the Sleep key a no-operation
    unless the software is updated to handle that event.

    Observations:
    - wireless and software present seen on receivers,
    reserved_r1b4 as well
    - the rest work only on devices as far as we can tell right now
    In the future would be useful to have separate enums for receiver
    and device notification flags, but right now we don't know enough.
