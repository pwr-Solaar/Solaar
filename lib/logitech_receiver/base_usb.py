## According to Logitech, they use the following product IDs (as of September 2020)
## USB product IDs for receivers: 0xC526 - 0xC5xx
## Wireless PIDs for hidpp10 devices: 0x2006 - 0x2019
## Wireless PIDs for hidpp20 devices: 0x4002 - 0x4097, 0x4101 - 0x4102
## USB product IDs for hidpp20 devices: 0xC07D - 0xC094, 0xC32B - 0xC344
## Bluetooth product IDs (for hidpp20 devices): 0xB012 - 0xB0xx, 0xB32A - 0xB3xx

# USB ids of Logitech wireless receivers.
# Only receivers supporting the HID++ protocol can go in here.

# max_devices is only used for receivers that do not support reading from _R.receiver_info offset 0x03, default to 1
# may_unpair is only used for receivers that do not support reading from _R.receiver_info offset 0x03, default to False
# unpair is for receivers that do support reading from _R.receiver_info offset 0x03, no default
## should this last be changed so that may_unpair is used for all receivers? writing to _R.receiver_pairing doesn't seem right
# re_pairs determines whether a receiver pairs by replacing existing pairings, default to False
## currently only one receiver is so marked - should there be more?
