# second is used for the receiver. In practise, the second byte is also used for
# some device-specific notifications (keyboard illumination level). Do not
# simply set all notification bits if the software does not support it. For
# example, enabling keyboard_sleep_raw makes the Sleep key a no-operation unless
# the software is updated to handle that event.

# - wireless and software present were seen on receivers, reserved_r1b4 as well
# - the rest work only on devices as far as we can tell right now
# In the future would be useful to have separate enums for receiver and device notification flags,
