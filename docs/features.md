A “read only” note means the feature is a read-only feature.

## Implementing a feature

Features are implemented as settable features in
lib/logitech_receiver/settings_templates.py
some features also have direct implementation in
lib/logitech_receiver/hidpp20.py

In most cases it should suffice to only implement the settable feature
interface for each setting in the feature.  That will add one or more
widgets in the Solaar main window to show and change the setting,
will permit storing and restoring changed settings, and
will output the feature settings in `solaar show`.

A setting implementation is a subclass of one of the built-in setting classes
illustrated by the pointer speed setting implementation.

```python
class PointerSpeed(_Setting):
    name = 'pointer_speed'
    label = _('Sensitivity (Pointer Speed)')
    description = _('Speed multiplier for mouse (256 is normal multiplier).')
    feature = _F.POINTER_SPEED
    validator_class = _RangeV
    min_value = 0x002e
    max_value = 0x01ff
    validator_options = {'byte_count': 2}
```

A setting implementation needs a name, a label, and a description.
The name is used in the persistent settings structure to store and restore changed settings and
should be a valid Python identifier.  (Some older settings have dashes.)
The label is displayed in the Solaar main window and the description is used as a tooltip there.
The label and description should be specified as translatable strings.
A setting implementation for a feature (for modern devices that use the HID++ 2.0 protocol)
needs a feature identifier.
A setting implementation needs a reader/writer and a validator.

The reader/writer is resposible for actually writing settings to the device
and reading them from the device, writing and reading the byte strings that
represent the setting values on the device.
For most feature settings the setting implementation can just inherit
the standard feature reader/writer, `FeatureRW`.

Options for `FeatureRW` are supplied by the `rw_options` class variable,
which is used to provide command numbers for reading and writing as well
as other information needed to identify the parts of the command and reponse
that hold the setting value and modify the reading and writing procedure.
`PointerSpeed` uses the defaults; here is an example of specifying non-default commands
for reading and writing:

```
    rw_options = {'read_fnid': 0x10, 'write_fnid': 0x20}
```

Some old devices use registers instead and the setting needs to use the register reader/writer.
Only implement a register interface for the setting if you are very brave and
you have access to a device that has a register interface for the setting.
Register interfaces cannot be auto-discovered and need to be stated in descriptors.py
for each device with the register interface.

The validator instance is responsible for turning raw values read from the device into Python data
and Python data into raw values to be written to the device and validating that the Python data is
acceptable for the setting.
There are several possible kinds of Python data for setting interfaces,
ranging from simple toggles, to ranges, to fixed lists, to
dynamic choices, to maps of dynamic choices.
Pointer speed is a setting whose values are integers in a range so _RangeV validator is used.
Arguments to validators are specified as class variables.
The _RangeV validator requires the minimum and maximum for the value as separate class variables
and the byte size of the value on the device as part of `validator_options`.
Splitting the minimum and maximum makes it easier for code that works with
settings to determine this information.
Settings that are toggles or choices work similarly,
but their validators have different arguments.
Map settings have more complicated validators and more arguments.

Settings where the acceptable values are determined from the device
subclass the validator and provide a build class method that queries the device
and creates an instance of the validator.
This method can also return `None`, indicating that even though the
device implements the feature it does not usefully support the setting.

Settings need to be added to the `SETTINGS` list so that setting discovery can be done.
