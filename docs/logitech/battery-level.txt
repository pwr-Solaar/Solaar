The battery/charging level and status is reported only if the related
reporting flag in register 0x00 is enabled by the host. The
"Battery/Charging Level" byte indicates the battery level if the
"Charging State" indicates 0x00 ("Not Charging"). If "Charging State"
indicates 0x21 to 0x23 ("Charging"), the "Battery/Charging Level" byte
indicates the level of charging.
