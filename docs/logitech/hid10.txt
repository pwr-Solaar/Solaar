Alternatively, if enabled, you can also receive a notification when a new
device is paired:

This message is sent by a receiver to the host SW to report a freshly
connected device. Enable the HID++ connection reporting by setting the
corresponding bit in register 0x00 via HID++ Set Register command.

To enable the notifications:
Enable HID++ Notifications:

This register defines a number of flags that allow the SW to turn on or off
individual spontaneous HID++ reports. Not setting a flag means default
reporting. See the table below for more details on each flag.

For all bits: *0 = disabled* (default value at power-up), 1 = enabled.
