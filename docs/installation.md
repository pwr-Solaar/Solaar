# Manual installation

### Requirements

You should have a reasonably new kernel (3.2+), with the `logitech-djreceiver`
driver enabled and loaded; also, the `udev` package must be installed and the
daemon running.  If you have a modern Linux distribution (2011+), you're most
likely good to go.

The command-line application (`bin/solaar-cli`) requires Python 2.7.3 or 3.2+
(either version should work), and the `python-pyudev`/`python3-pyudev` package.

The GUI application (`bin/solaar`) also requires Gtk3, and its GObject
Introspection bindings. The Debian/Ubuntu package names are
`python-gi`/`python3-gi` and `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`; if you're using another
distribution the required packages are most likely named something similar.
If the desktop notifications bindings are also installed (`gir1.2-notify-0.7`),
you will also get desktop notifications when devices come online/go offline.

### Installation

Normally USB devices are not accessible for r/w by regular users, so you will
need to do a one-time udev rule installation to allow access to the Logitech
Unifying Receiver.

You can run the `rules.d/install.sh` script from Solaar to do this installation
automatically (it will switch to root when necessary), or you can do all the
required steps by hand, as the root user:

1. Copy `rules.d/99-logitech-unifying-receiver.rules` from Solaar to
   `/etc/udev/rules.d/`. udev will automatically pick up this file using
   inotify.

   By default, the rule allows all members of the `plugdev` group to have
   read/write access to the Unifying Receiver device. (standard Debian/ Ubuntu
   group for pluggable devices). It may need changes, specific to your
   particular system's configuration. If in doubt, replacing `GROUP="plugdev"`
   with `GROUP="<your username>"` should just work.

2. Physically remove the Unifying Receiver and re-insert it.

   This is necessary because if the receiver is already plugged-in, it already
   has a `/dev/hidraw?` device node, but with the old (`root:root`) permissions.
   Plugging it again will re-create the device node with the right permissions.

3. Make sure your desktop users are part of the `plugdev` group, by running
   `gpasswd $USER plugdev` as root. If these users were not assigned to the
   group before, they must re-login for the changes to take effect.
