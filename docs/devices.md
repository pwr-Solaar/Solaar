# Supported devices and receivers

These tables list Logitech receivers and devices and to what degree their
features are supported by Solaar.  The information in these tables is
incomplete, based on what devices users have been able to test Solaar with.

The HID++ column specifies the device's HID++ version.  Some devices report
version 4.5, but that is the same as version 2.0 as listed here.
For devices what support HID++ 2.0 or greater, Solaar is able to discover
the features the device supports.

The Battery column specifies if Solaar is able to read the device's battery
level.

For mice, the DPI column specifies if the mouse's sensitivity is fixed (`-`),
can only be read (`R`), or can be read and changed by Solaar (`R/W`).

If your device works with Solaar, but its supported features are not
correctly specified here, please open an issue on the [Solaar github
repository][solaar] with the pleasant news.

### Adding new receivers and devices

Adding a new receiver requires knowing whether the receiver is a regular
Unifying receiver, a nano receiver, or a lightspeed receiver.  Add a line to
../lib/logitech_receiver/base_usb.py defining the receiver as one of these.
If the receiver has an unusual number of pairing slots then this also needs
to be specified.  Then add the receiver to the tuple of receivers (ALL).

To let Solaar read and write to the receiver information on it needs to be
added to rules.d/42-logitech-unify-permissions.rules.  Add a new line to
that file with the vendor and product ids, just like the other lines in the
file.  Then this file has to be copied into /etc/udev/rules.d

Most new devices do not need to be known to Solaar to work.  However, an
entry in lib/logitech-receiver/descriptors.py can provide a better name for
the device and a feature list can speed up Solaar startup a bit.  The
arguments to the _D function are the device's long name, its short name
(codename), its HID++ protocol version, its wireless product ID (wpid), and
a tuple of known feature settings (from lib/logitech/settings_templates.py).

* The [K750 Solar Keyboard][K750] can be queried for its solar charge status.
  Pressing the `Light-Check` button on the keyboard will pop-up the application
  window and display the current lighting value (Lux) as reported by the
  keyboard, similar to Logitech's *Solar.app* for Windows.

* FN swap changes the way the function keys (`F1`..`F12`) work, i.e., whether holding `FN` while pressing the function keys will generate the standard `Fx` keycodes or the special function (yellow icons) keycodes.
